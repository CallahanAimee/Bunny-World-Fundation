           <h2>What should I feed my bunny?</h2>
           <p>The House Rabbit Society stresses that rabbits should live indoors, and have at least four hours of quality running/playing time per day. This, in conjunction with a proper diet, will help keep your rabbit happy, healthy and affectionate for a lifetime. Perhaps the most important items in the rabbit diet that ensure good intestinal health are (1) adequate oral hydration and (2) adequate crude long fiber, which helps push hair and food through the intestines, and keeps the intestinal muscles well toned and moving quickly. <br> This is essential to the rabbit's maintenance of a balance flora (bacteria and yeast) in the cecum. Improper diet can quickly lead to intestinal problems, often originating with cecal dysbiosis, an imbalance of the natural "ecosystem" of the cecum. Here are the most important items that you should be sure to include in your rabbit's diet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item3">
            <h4>HAY!</h4>
           <p>Perhaps the single most important item in the rabbit diet is grass HAY, and it should be fed in unlimited quantities to both adults and baby rabbits. A rabbit fed only commercial rabbit pellets does not get enough long fiber to keep the intestines in good working order. The long fibers in the hay push things through the gut and keep the intestinal muscles in good tone. In addition to keeping the intestinal contents moving at the rate at which nature intended, hay may also help prevent intestinal impactions caused by ingested hair or other indigestible items. Alfalfa or clover hays, although tasty for the rabbit, are too rich in protein and calcium to be fed ad libitum. Instead, offer fresh grass hays such as timothy, oat, coastal, brome, Bahia or wheat. If you can't find good quality hay locally, you may wish to mail order hay from Oxbow Hay Company or American Pet Diner. Oxbow carries the coarser "first cut" timothy hay that is higher in fiber. American Pet Diner carries both first cut and the softer, more fragrant "second cut". Second cut hay is lower in fiber, but some rabbits who refuse to eat the (putatively healthier) high-fiber first cut will often eagerly accept second cut hay. Less fiber is better than none at all!</p>
            <h4>Water</h4>
            <p>The importance of adequate water intake cannot be overstated. A rabbit who does not drink sufficient water will gradually begin to suffer desiccation of the intestinal contents. It seems that even when the tissues of the rabbit appear to be well-hydrated, the intestinal contents may not be, perhaps because the rabbit is so efficient at sequestering necessary fluids from its own intestine.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item4">
           <h4>Pellets</h4>
           <p>A good-quality commercial rabbit pellet provides trace nutrients, vitamins and minerals that a rabbit might not get if fed only hay and fresh foods. However, very little pelleted food is required for good health. Many experienced rabbit veterinarians are now recommending no more than 1/8 cup of quality pellets per 5 lbs. of rabbit per day, and some even consider commercial pellets a "treat food" that can promote obesity in spayed/neutered adult rabbits. A rabbit fed too many pellets will often ignore his hay, to the detriment of his intestinal system!

            A good quality rabbit pellet DOES NOT contain dried fruit, seeds, nuts, colored crunchy things or other things that are attractive to our human eyes, but very unhealthy to a rabbit. Rabbits are strict herbivores, and in nature they rarely get fruit, nuts or other such fatty, starchy foods. The complex flora of the cecum can quickly become dangerously imbalanced if too much simple, digestible carbohydrate is consumed--especially if the diet is generally low in fiber. The result is often "poopy butt syndrome," in which mushy fecal matter cakes onto the rabbit's behind. This a sign of cecal dysbiosis, which can foment much more serious health problems.
            
             A good quality rabbit pellet should have at least 22% crude fiber, no more than approximately 14% protein, about 1% fat and about 1.0% calcium. Check the label on the rabbit pellets before you buy. Most commercial pellets are alfalfa-based, which means they're higher in calories and lower in fiber than timothy-based pellets. The latter are available from quality feed companies such as Oxbow or American Pet Diner.
            
            Baby rabbits may be fed unlimited pellets, as their bones and muscles need plenty of protein and calcium for proper growth. However, the calories and nutrients of commercial pellets fed ad libitum exceeds the needs of a healthy adult rabbit, and will not only promote obesity, but discourage the rabbit from consuming enough hay to ensure intestinal health.
            
            The wise "bunny parent" will begin to gradually taper the quantity of pellets once the rabbit is about eight to twelve months old. and feed no more than 1/8 cup per day for every four pounds of rabbit (you can give a little bit more if the pellets are timothy-based). Some rabbit caregivers complain that their rabbits won't eat their hay. If the problem is not medical in nature (e.g., molar spurs and other dental problems are a common problem responsible for "picky eating"), then it may be that the rabbit is eating too many pellets, isn't hungry, and so doesn't eat the hay so vital to his/her health. Take the tough love approach! Cut back the pellets until you are sure your rabbit is eating enough hay.</p>
            <h4>Fresh Vegetables</h4>
            <p>You may have heard it from a breeder, pet store owner, or even a veterinarian who is not as familiar with recent rabbit health information as one might hope: Fresh vegetables will give your rabbit "diarrhea." Nothing could be further from the truth than this old myth. In fact, fresh greens help keep intestinal contents hydrated, which makes them easier for the bunny to pass. Trace nutrients, fiber, and just plain old tastiness are other benefits of fresh greens. After all, what do you suppose wild rabbits eat?

                Fresh, moist greens are about as important as hay in maintaining a healthy intestine. Try broccoli, dark leaf lettuces, kale, parsley, carrots (with tops!), endive, escarole, dill, basil, mint, cilantro, culantro, spinach, tomato, celery (cut up into 1" pieces, to avoid problems with the tough strings getting stuck on the molars!). Almost any green, leafy vegetable that's good for you (including fresh-grown garden herbs such as tarragon and various mints, with the exception of Pennyroyal) are good for a rabbit. Experiment and see which types your rabbit likes best! Rabbits love fresh, fragrant herbs fresh from the garden.
                
                Give starchy vegetables (e.g., carrots) in moderation, and use bits of fruit only in very, very small quantities, as special treats. Too much sugar and starch can cause cecal dysbiosis, and all its associated problems.
                
                Baby rabbits may start receiving greens very gradually at the age of about two months. Add one item at a time, in small amounts, and if you see no intestinal upset, add another. Carrots, romaine lettuce and kale are good starters. A five pound adult rabbit should receive at least four heaping cups of fresh, varied (at least three different kinds each day) vegetables per day. Be sure to wash everything thoroughly to remove pesticide and fertilizer residues as much as possible. Even organic produce should be washed well to remove potentially harmful bacteria, such as E. coli.
                
                Serve the vegetables wet, as this will help increase your rabbit's intake of liquid. This helps keep the intestinal contents moving well, and the bunny healthy.
                
                Please don't make the mistake of serving less-than-fresh vegetables to your rabbit. A rabbit is even more sensitive to spoiled food than a human is. If the vegetables smell stale or "on the fringe", they could make your bunny sick. Follow the Emerald Rule of Freshness when feeding your rabbit friend: "Don't Feed it to Your Bunny if You Wouldn't Eat it Yourself."</p>
            <h4>Fresh Fruits?</h4>
            <p>These are considered treats, and should be fed in very limited quantities (no more than two tablespoons a day for a five pound rabbit!), if at all. Safe choices are apple, apricot, banana, cherries, mango, peach, plum, papaya, pineapple, apricot, berries....just about any fruit you would like is okay for your bunny. Be very careful not to overdo these treat foods, as they may promote cecal dysbiosis, other intestinal problems and create a desire in the bunny to eat treats instead of his/her normal, healthy foods.</p>

           <h2>The Deadly Secret of Santee Alley</h2>
           <p><em>The Deadly Secret of Santee Alley" is a film about the efforts of Bunny World Foundation to unveil the horrors of illegal animal trade at Santee Alley and raise awareness of animal cruelty Downtown Los Angeles.</em></p>
           <p>Take a walk down Santee Alley, the garment district of downtown Los Angeles, and you will unveil horrors of the seemingly innocent animal trade. "They" are breeding them under the worst possible conditions, and discarding their mothers after they are unable to "produce" any more. Snake food? Bulldog training? Gift for a laboratory testing? Food? We don't know, but what we do know is that the babies are supposed to stay with their mothers for at least 8 weeks. Instead, "They" snatch them when they are 8 - 10 days old, eyes closed, chances of survival minimal, and sell them in Santee Alley for a pittance as "pets." "They" feed the babies lettuce and carrots which gives them diarrhea and, after hours of seizures, causes a slow and painful death. During the summer, babies are put in miserable bird cages, dehydrated, starved and kept in filthy conditions. During the winter, they freeze and die before they even reach the shelter. These babies are being sold as pets for children. Those who buy them typically end up with a dead bunny the next day.</p>
           <p>At times, the LAPD impound the animals, chase "Them" away and call animal control to pick them up. Since "They" are not penalized, "They" come back the next day and it's the same atrocity all over again. The LA Fashion BID (Business Improvement District) trucks come and pick up the animals (bunnies, birds, turtles, etc.) take them to their field office, and keep them there for LA Animal Control to pick up. In the past, once the animals were taken to "safety" at the North LA Animal shelter, they were euthanized the very same day they were "rescued." However, since June 15th, 2008, BTW has been in the trenches with LA Fashion BID staff fighting against this problem. Not only have we brought the attention of the authorities to this illegal and cruel activity, but we have also begun rescuing these bunnies so that they are not sent to a certain death through LA Animal Control. Once rescued, we pick them up, de-worm them, de-flea them, give them medicine and wean them for two months until they are strong enough to live on hay, veggies and pellets. Then we look for good homes where they can live happy and safe.</p>
           <p>While the City consider this atrocious act a simple misdemeanor, we think of it as animal cruelty. Not only is this an issue of animal cruelty, but it is an issue of public health and safety. The CDC warns against catching salmonella from turtles that can also spread other diseases, such as TB, chlamydiosis, arizonosis, and colibacillosis. The sale of turtles smaller than 4 inches has been banned since 1975; but this doesn't stop "Them" from selling those babies. IT IS A HEALTH ISSUE, A CHILD LABOR ISSUE, A GANG ISSUE, AN IMMIGRATION ISSUES, AN ANIMAL CRUELTY ISSUE, A TAXPAYER ISSUE.</p>
           <p>Common sense tells us that this "revelation" would bring about a concerted effort by the city and County, but the LAPD claim that they are unable to stop this cruelty. Our emails with the City of LA are answered but not acted upon. At first, they told us how difficult it was to increase the fines, how difficult it was to stop the vendors, how difficult it was to change the law and how difficult it was to consider this act of animal cruelty a crime — not misdemeanor. We have written to the District Attorney's Office, the Mayor's Office and the Governor, but we were ignored! We even risked our lives to take photos of the criminals and supply them to LAPD. Fifty photos and a video have been supplied to the LAPD but they still haven't processed a police report, let alone prosecute these vendors.  Now, THREE YEARS LATER, something is finally being done...</p>
           <p>In June of 2008, our Founder, Lejla Hadzimuratovic, almost lost her life by confronting these vendors... but no one cared. Even PETA, which originally sent her there as a volunteer, washed their hands of this case, and advised her that these animals should be euthanized and that they were "sorry" that she was attacked. Los Angeles Downtown News published a story by Anna Scott, who ironically captured the very same vendors' faces on her camera who were still standing on the very same corner and selling more bunnies, salmonella-infected turtles and little birds.</p>
